Place your pre-generated MP4 videos in this folder.

Naming rules:
- Lowercase
- Spaces become underscores
- Only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Add .mp4 extension

Examples:
- hello.mp4
- thank_you.mp4
- good_morning.mp4

The app will try the full phrase first (e.g., "good morning" -> good_morning.mp4).
If not found, it will try individual words and play the first available video.
