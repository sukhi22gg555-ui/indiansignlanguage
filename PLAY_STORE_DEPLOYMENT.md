# Play Store Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through the process of deploying your Indian Sign Language app to the Google Play Store.

## 📦 Generated Files

Your app has been successfully built and is ready for deployment. The following files have been generated:

- **AAB (Android App Bundle)**: `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- **APK (Debug)**: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **APK (Release - Unsigned)**: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

### 🎯 Recommended for Play Store: AAB File
The Android App Bundle (`.aab`) file is the recommended format for Play Store uploads as it allows Google Play to optimize app delivery.

## 🔐 App Signing

### Important Note
The current AAB file is **unsigned**. For Play Store deployment, you need to:

### Option 1: Google Play App Signing (Recommended)
1. Upload the unsigned AAB to Play Console
2. Let Google Play manage your app signing key
3. Google will sign your app automatically

### Option 2: Manual Signing
If you prefer to sign manually:

```bash
# Generate a keystore (do this once)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Sign the AAB
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore app-release.aab my-key-alias

# Verify the signature
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app-release.aab
```
